# Codex Transcript Summary

Launches [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) when Tuple transcription completes and asks it to summarize the completed transcript.

The trigger writes a `summarize-in-codex.command` wrapper next to the transcript files and opens it in your preferred terminal. The wrapper runs as `#!/bin/zsh -li`, so `codex` resolves from the same interactive shell environment you get in a new terminal. No install location is hard-coded.

Codex starts in the transcription directory with a focused summary prompt. It reads the whole call by running Tuple's bundled watcher (`tuple-call-watcher.py --catchup`, shipped with this trigger), produces a concise summary with decisions, action items, and open questions, then stays available for transcript-backed follow-up questions. It runs `--sandbox read-only` (the summary only needs to read), with `--ask-for-approval on-failure` so the run stays unattended.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) installed so `codex` works in a new terminal
- `python3` (the bundled watcher needs it; install with `xcode-select --install`)
- Tuple transcription enabled for the call

## Installation

Drop this directory into your Tuple triggers folder:

`~/.tuple/triggers/codex-transcript-summary/`

The trigger fires when call transcription completes.

## How it works

When `call-transcription-complete` fires, Tuple provides `TUPLE_TRIGGER_CALL_ARTIFACTS_DIRECTORY`, the directory containing the completed transcription artifacts. This trigger:

1. Copies the fixed `tuple-call-watcher.py` and writes `codex-summary-prompt.md` into that directory.
2. Writes an executable `summarize-in-codex.command` wrapper into that directory.
3. Opens it in your preferred terminal via `open` (Ghostty → iTerm → Alacritty → Terminal; set `PREFERRED_TERM` to choose). No AppleScript, so it triggers no macOS accessibility prompt.
4. The wrapper starts a login interactive zsh shell, changes into the transcription directory, and runs `codex --sandbox read-only` with the summary prompt.

For local script testing without opening a terminal, set `CODEX_TRANSCRIPT_SUMMARY_DRY_RUN=1`.
